    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Rare variants comprise the most frequently observed type of genetic variation in human genomes, and have the potential to be informative in genomic studies. Doubletons are a particular class of rare variation defined by being observed only twice across a population of samples. Previous work has demonstrated that the pairwise sharing of such variants between individuals can reflect patterns of recent shared demography, and in turn fine-scale genetic population structure [(Mathieson and McVean, 2014)](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004528). The demographic information revealed by the analysis of rare variation has broad applications across a variety of sub-fields of human genetics, including adjusting for population structure in genome-wide discovery efforts [(Persyn et al. 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6283567/), accounting for stratification in the calculation of polygenic risk scores [Zaidi and Mathieson, 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61548), understanding patterns of segregation of clinically relevant variation, and elucidating historical relationships between groups via genomic analysis [(Gravel et al 2011)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1019276108).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ascertainment of genetic variation on genome-wide arrays typically prohibits the analysis of rare variant sharing in an unbiased manner; however with the recent increase in public availability of whole genomes captured via deep sequencing, there are emerging opportunities to explore and further characterize rare variation at the population scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging the Gencove Explorer platform, we will demonstrate how one might characterize patterns of rare genetic variation in population scale whole genome sequence data, and apply unsupervised machine learning in order to extract insights from patterns inherent within the data. \n",
    "We do this by utilizing the 1000 Genomes Project and Human Genome Diversity Panel [(Koenig et al. 2023)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9900804/) a globally diverse population-scale dataset comprised of N=4094 whole genomes covering n=77 population groupings, and encompassing over 153 million genetic variants,released as part of GNOMAD v3.2.1.\n"

    "\n",
    "Here we have demonstrated how to perform population scale analysis of a large dataset of whole-genome sequence data by leveraging the Explorer SDK, the Explorer Object Store, and the analysis cluster that accompanies every Explorer deployment. We were able to retrieve and process a large, population-scale dataset of whole genome sequence data in a job submitted to the cluster, retrieve the output of the analysis, and create visualizations within a single Jupyter notebook. By analyzing patterns of rare variant sharing, we were able to explore patterns of population structure in the diverse 1KG + HGDP dataset via unsupervised machine learning over doubleton sharing and uncover communities of individuals enriched for sharing of rare variants. Lastly, we demonstrated that these correlate with available populations labels for the 1KG + HGDP data.\n",
